## Introduction

Great UX starts with two basic principles - ease of use and simplicity. Selecting a color should be as easy as moving a slider, clicking a checkbox or pressing a key just like other basic form elements behave.

This is a flexible and minimalistic color picker. Developed with mobile devices and keyboard usage in mind. Key features:
* Small size - 3.8 KB gzipped (JS and CSS combined)
* Supports touch devices
* Optimized animations
* Ease of use
    * Double click anywhere to move the knob to a color
    * <kbd>Tab</kbd> to focus the picker
    * <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd> arrow key to increase hue. <kbd>Shift + ↑/→</kbd> to go quicker and <kbd>Ctrl + ↑/→</kbd> to go even quicker.
    * <kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd> arrow key to decrease hue. <kbd>Shift + ↓/←</kbd> to go quicker and <kbd>Ctrl + ↓/←</kbd> to go even quicker.
    * <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select a color and close the picker or to open it
    * Mouse <kbd>ScrollUp</kbd> to increase and <kbd>ScrollDown</kbd> to decrease hue (Opt-in)

## Usage

Color Picker on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker)
```bash
npm install @radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker
```

And in your app:

```vue
<template>
    <color-picker v-bind="color" @input="onInput"></color-picker>
</template>

<script>
import ColorPicker from '@radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker';

export default {
    components: { ColorPicker },
    data() {
        return {
            color: {
                hue: 50,
                saturation: 100,
                luminosity: 50,
                alpha: 1
            },
        };
    },
    methods: {
        onInput(hue) {
            this.color.hue = hue;
        },
    },
};
</script>

<style>
@import '~@radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker/dist/vue-color-picker.min.css';
</style>
```

## Options
`<color-picker>` component has several props and events. [See the "with-config" example](./examples/with-config) which uses all options.

## Migration from v1

Straight forward - `v-model` becomes `v-bind` and you need to add the `@input` event (which was previously added by the `v-model` directive implicitly).

```diff
<template>
-   <color-picker v-model="color"></color-picker>
+   <color-picker v-bind="color" @input="onInput"></color-picker>
</template>

<script>
import ColorPicker from '@radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker';

export default {
    components: { ColorPicker },
    data() {
        return {
            color: {
                hue: 50,
                saturation: 100,
                luminosity: 50,
                alpha: 1
            },
        };
    },
+   methods: {
+       onInput: function(hue) {
+           this.color.hue = hue;
+       }
+   }
};
```
